Check out a video of the prototype:

This was made to try out some of the new features in Unity back in 2019. Mainly focused around using the job system to generate a world. I also wanted to see if I could create a new take on the block building game. The world is infinitely generating and on a "treadmill" (geometry is continually moved back to the origin) so there is zero graphical issues or bugs with running in a continued direction indefinitely.

To complete the prototype I would add to the "dark cross section" so the world appears to be cut in half so you can't see the green background below the terrain. This would be achieved relatively simply with additional meshes.

If fully realised I would have added "Smash Brothers" type brawl fighting mechanics. With a lot of features seen in the game "Ark" but with instead of dinosaurs I would have added orcs, dwarfs and elves that could have been fought and recruited to fight along side you. The game would have dedicated servers with around 100 players for PVP and PVE gameplay and rely on Steam for matching and finding servers.
